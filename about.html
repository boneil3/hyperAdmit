                    <p>Applying to college is a mess. Prior to HyperAdmit, families who were getting started with the college admisisons process needed to digest conflicting advice from friends, family, teachers, admissions counselors, and private admissions consultants. The advice was ambiguous at best and damaging at worst. By skipping the admissions advice middlemen, we knew we could make the process easier for families HyperAdmit was born. By anonymizing and verifying you and the admissions officer, HyperAdmit lets you get best practices and position your application with a real college admissions officer.<br><br>When it comes to college admissions, only the admissions officers themselves know the secret formula. We knew we could create an easy and ethical way for admissions officers to consult families on how to best position themselves for top colleges. HyperAdmit was born.</p>
